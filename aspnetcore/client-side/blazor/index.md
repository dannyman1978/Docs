# ASP.NET Core Blazor

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/blazor-preview-notice.md)]

Blazor is a new experimental .NET web framework using C#/Razor and HTML that runs in the browser with WebAssembly.

To learn more about Blazor's technological backbone, see the following documentation sets: [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/), [C# Guide](/dotnet/csharp/), [Razor](xref:mvc/views/razor), and [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/).

## Get started

For an overview of Blazor features, see [Blazor at the .NET website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/web/blazor). For development setup instructions and a quick blast of Blazor, see [Get started with Blazor in 10 minutes](https://www.microsoft.com/net/web/blazor/get-started). You can find answers to common questions in the [Blazor FAQ](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor/wiki/FAQ).
